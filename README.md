# Overview

    This repository will store any notable projects I have worked on.

# Overview of the Automation System functionality


# Overview of the EPubReader functionality

    Plan on implementing once done with AutomationSystem

# Overview of Strassen's Algorithm Functionality
    The Strassen's algorithm project seeks to show an example of both a naive, traditional matrix multiplication algorithm, and Strassen's algorithm. Via these implementations, we seek to explore the asymptotic complexities associated with both types of algorithms, via timing code. 

# Time Expenditures:

    Expected / Actual           Project Name            Notes
    30 /                        Automation System
    5 / 4                       Strassen's Algorithm    Implementation completed and seems to work properly
