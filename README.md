# Overview

This repository will store any notable projects I have worked on.

# Overview of the Automation System functionality

    TODO::: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

# Overview of the EPubReader functionality

Plan on implementing once done with AutomationSystem

# Overview of Page Rank Analysis Project
This project did not require coding and thus no functionality needs to be noted. The PageRankAnalysis folder contains a PowerPoint and PDF document of the presentation I prepared, a short PDF of notes I created, and a PDF documenting the requirements for this presentation. This project sought to explain how Page Rank works, its impact in computing, and the Linear Algebra that allows the algorithm to function.

# Overview of Strassen's Algorithm Project
The Strassen's algorithm project seeks to show an example of both a naive, traditional matrix multiplication algorithm, and Strassen's algorithm. Via these implementations, we seek to explore the asymptotic complexities associated with both types of algorithms, via timing code. 

# Overview of Steam Analysis Project
The Steam Analysis Project seeks to analyze how Database Management Systems and Content Delivery Networks create the backbone of Steam, Valve's Digital Distribution Network.

# Project Ideas to Implement
    Markov Chain implementations trained on data to predict weather/stock market trends. 
    Hand-Drawn Number Recognition using TensorFlow/PyTorch
    (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning for Machine Learning + Interpolation implementation traditional vs AI model interpolation)
