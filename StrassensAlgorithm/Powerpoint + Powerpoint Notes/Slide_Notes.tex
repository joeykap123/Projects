\section{History}
    Speaks for itself

\section{Traditional Matrix Multiplication}
    Speaks for itself

\section{Strassen's Algorithm}
    Speaks for itself

\section{Winograd's Algorithm}
    Speaks for itself

\section{Asymptotic Complexity of Straseen's Algorithm}
    Reference how multiplication is a more intensive, longer operations compared to addition subtraction (Relate to assembly code and computer architecture)

\section{Implementation Considerations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Talk about why Strassen's algorithm is more efficient for large matrices, but is not much better than traditional matrix multiplication algorithms for smaller matrices.
        \item Talk about the "padding" seen earlier and why it is necessary
        \item Talk about memory and why Strassen's algorithm can be difficult to implement and problematic if implemented incorrectly.
        \item Talk about the problem of using incorrect data types (i.e., double v int) (NOTE that this is important for any algorithm)
        \item Talk about caching and why it enable this algorithm to perform efficiently 
    \end{itemize}
    

\section{Implementation via Python}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explain recursive nature of Strassen's algorithm vs non-recursive nature of traditional matrix multiplication algorithm
        \item Explain timing tests of both algorithms and what the tests indicate
    \end{itemize}


\section{Current State-of-the-Art Algorithms}
    Only a few examples of improvements to matrix multiplication algorithms time complexity; many more exist.
