# Overview

This README contains details in reference to the Strassen's algorithm project

# Overview of Strassen's Algorithm functionality
    The Strassen's algorithm class seeks to represent an implementation of Strassen's algorithm. The sole method within this class, Strassens(), uses the recursive algorithm defined by Volker Strassen to compute the result of matrix multiplication.

# Overview of Traditional Matrix Multiplication functionality
    The Traditional Matrix Multiplication class seeks to represent an implementation of a naive, traditional matrix multiplication algorithm. THe sole method within this class, MatrixMultiplicationMethod(), uses the traditional triple nested for-loop to compute the result of matrix multiplication.

# Overview of Traditional Timing Class
    This Traditional Timing Class seeks to compute the time complexity associated with the MatrixMultiplicationMethod() method as the dimensions of both matrices scale.

# Overview of Strassen's Timing Class
    This Strassen's Timing Class seeks to compute the time complexity associated with the Strassens() method as the dimensions of both matrices scale
